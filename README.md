# Gaming-Data-Analysis

The game has been developed by a company and is available for free as many of the same genre games. Though the game is free, there are optional items that can be purchased by the gamers to enhance their play. The management needs a report that gives a break down of the game's purchasing data with meaningful insights. To gather these meaningful insights, pandas in python has been used.
